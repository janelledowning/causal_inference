causal_inference
================

This is the portfolio of my work in Causal Inference (PH 252D) at University of California, Berkeley


**Course summary**: This course presents a general framework for causal inference. Directed acyclic graphs and non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEM) are used to define the causal model. Target causal parameters are defined using counterfactuals and marginal structural models. G-computation estimators, inverse probability weighted estimators, and targeted maximum likelihood estimators are introduced. Non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches to nuisance parameter estimation, with an emphasis on Super Learning, are presented. Students gain practical experience implementing these estimators and interpreting results through discussion assignments, R labs, and R assignments. 

**Course learning objectives**:

1)    Translate a scientific question and background knowledge into a causal model and target causal parameter using the NPSEM/counterfactual frameworks.

2)    Assess identifiability of the target causal parameter and express it as a parameter of the observed data distribution.

3)    Understand the challenge posed by the curse of dimensionality; be familiar with and able to apply data adaptive (machine learning) approaches.

4)    Understand the properties of and be able to apply three classes of causal effect estimators.

5)    Time permitting: Understand the challenge of time-dependent confounding in longitudinal data and the limitations of traditional regression-based adjustment.
