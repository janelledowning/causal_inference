causal_inference
================

This is the portfolio of my work in Causal Inference (PH 252D) at University of California, Berkeley

**Course summary**: This course presents a general framework for causal inference. Directed acyclic graphs and non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEM) are used to define the causal model. Target causal parameters are defined using counterfactuals and marginal structural models. G-computation estimators, inverse probability weighted estimators, and targeted maximum likelihood estimators are introduced. Non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches to nuisance parameter estimation, with an emphasis on Super Learning, are presented.
